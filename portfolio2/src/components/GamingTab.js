                    I wasn't going to add this, but gaming is my passion and I can't escape it.

                    I began gaming at ~6-years-old, my dad would drop my brother and I off at a PC cafe as a pseudo day-care to play friendly MMOs like Maplestory. 
                    <br></br>
                    Here, I was able to gain a competitive drive from CS 1.6 & WC3 DotA by scrimmming adults 3x my age.
                    <br></br>
                    I went to ghetto schools so I wasn't challenged in any of my classes; I would finish homework in class to min/max my gaming time.
                    In this time, I studied the METAs & tried to acheive the highest rank in every game I played.
                    <br></br>
                    While my Chinese family hated my gaming addiction, it surpringly paid off & I can say video games got me out of the ghetto.  
                    <br></br>
                    In 2013, I was 15-years-old at the peak of my League of Legends career and received a random friend request asking if I was interested in ELO boosting.
                    I made the decision to focus on school and give up my dreams of playing professionally for this entreprenual opportunity.
                    <br></br>
                    I made over $60,000 by 16. I earned ~$30k from one summer, had my bank and paypal funds frozen under suspicion of laundering, and almost kicked out because my dad thought I was selling drugs.
                    <br></br> 
                    From this funding, I was able to invest into BitCoin years before its peak in 2017 and move out + pay for college by myself.
                    <br></br>
                    I love all video games. The genre's I've hit at least top 0.1% for are FPS, RTS, Fighting Games, and MOBAs. I also have sunk a good chunk of my life in MMORPGs and Mobile Gacha Games among others.
